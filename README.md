In order to access your custom visualization, go to 'http://sudarshangp.github.io/CS467/' and follow the instruction to create a bookmark. 

Open facebook.com and click on the bookmark. This will lead you to a page with information about your facebook interactions. Click on the 'download JSON' button to download the data as a .json file. Place this file in the folder with the code for the implementation.

Run the python script 'script.py' that is in the implementation folder. Following that, open the terminal and use python's hosting service by typing in 'python -m SimpleHTTPModule'. This will default to hosting this implemetation on the 8000 port on your localhost.

Open the Google Chrome Browser and go to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' to view your visulization of 'Hey Facebook, Who Am I?'.

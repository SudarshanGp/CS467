<h1>Hey Facebook, Who Am I?</h1>
<p>Our visualization attempts to reveal what Facebook knows about its users, and allows the users to learn about their social graph rankings through tie strength score, specifically how other people who may or may not be user’s friends, groups, pages and apps rank against each other. </p>
<p>Since the data and visualization is highly personal, we implore the user to ask themselves the following questions as they explore their social graph.<br>
<ol>
  <li>What does the user use FB primarily for: connecting with friends, interacting with groups, getting updates from their favorite pages or for apps and games connected to FB? Compare the rankings of groups or pages with those of other users.</li>
  <li>Who are user’s top friends they interact with the most?</li>
  <li>How does the rank of user’s significant others and family members compare with rankings of other FB users? Note that significant other and family may be ranked lower if FB is not the primary means to communicate with them. This may generate insight about who does the user connect with through Facebook and how might one tailor FB activity to best suit the interests of intended audiences?</li>
  <li>Who does the user stalk? Notice how visualization includes people who are not user’s friends.</li>
  <li>Is the user jealous of or still in love with an ex based on how they rank compared to user’s significant other? </li>
  <li>Are your ‘Close Friends’ on Facebook really your close friends on Facebook?</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>For this purpose, we used Facebook’s very own blackbox data that Facebook uses for its own search ranking feature and hence, this visualization makes very few assumptions while data wrangling. </p>
<p>User may notice that recently added friends are ranked higher which suggests Facebook’s understanding of human psychology that new friendships compete with existing ones to survive, and if they are not nurtured within first few weeks, then they die.
</p>
<p>Other data points that majorly affect score of tie-strengths between two nodes are search history, messenger conversations, location or physical proximity and gender. This depicts Facebook’s deep understanding of human psychology. From another perspective, one might argue that Facebook knows who you are going to search for/ are most likely to search for before you even search for them. To a user, it may help answer questions about how much personal information they give to Facebook and whether they are compromising their valuable privacy for a free service. It may also help them understand how powerful Facebook’s machine learning algorithms are in making sense of user data.</p>
